1)Using input() function take one number from the user and using ternary oerators?check whether the number is even or odd?
Code:
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")

Output:
Enter a number: 12
The number is even

2)Using input function take two number and then swap the number?
Code:
# Taking two numbers input from the user
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

 # Swapping the numbers
number1 = number1 + number2
number2 = number1 - number2
number1 = number1 - number2
 
# Displaying the swapped numbers
print("After swapping:")
print("First number:", number1)
print("Second number:", number2)

Output:
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10
After swapping:
First number: 10
Second number: 5
